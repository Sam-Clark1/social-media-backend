## Installation
Download files and run 'npm i' in the console to download all the required npm packages.

## Usage
Once all packages have been downloaded, run 'npm start' in the console to start the express server. The api endpoints will begin with either 'api/users' or 'api/thoughts'. Use the routes found in the routes/api folder to see if more is required for the input based on the operation you would like to do. You can view a tutorial video on how to call all the available endpoints <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2ib8BUolWgmfQ1GAxTq9jsGr6F2ojcq/view' target='_blank'>here.</a>  

## Contributing
I am open to contributions. This can be done in the form of pull requests on the GitHub repo.

## Tests
Can use Jest to test the dateFormat function. To use Jest, run 'npm i jest' in the console to download the Jest package. To run tests, run 'npm test' in the command line.
